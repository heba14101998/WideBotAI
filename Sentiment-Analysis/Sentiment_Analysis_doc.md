# Sentiment Analysis using NLP: A Detailed Guide

---

### 1. Introduction**

Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding customer feedback, gauging public opinion, and improving marketing strategies. This project aims to build a system that can accurately classify the sentiment expressed in text data.

* **Objectives:** 
    * Explore and visioalize text dataset.
    * Apply data normalization and preprocessing techniques.
    * Develop a sentiment analysis pipeline.
    * Compare the performance of traditional NLP methods (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) with a deep learning approach (BERT).
    * Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in terms of performance, interpretability, and computational resources.

### 2. Data Description

"Tweet Sentiment Extraction" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/data), focuses on the task of **extracting sentiment-bearing phrases from tweets**. It's designed for training machine learning models to understand the nuanced sentiments expressed in tweets and identify the specific text within the tweet that conveys that sentiment. Here's a breakdown of the dataset:

**Data Structure:**

* **`train.csv`:** Contains the training data with 27480 rows.
* **`test.csv`:** Contains the testing data with 3534 rows.

**Columns:**

* **`text`:** The full text of the tweet. I will use this column in the following work.
* **`sentiment`:** The overall sentiment of the tweet, classified as either "positive", "negative", or "neutral".
* **`selected_text`:** The portion of the tweet that expresses the sentiment (this is the target variable).

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* **Purpose:** Understand the characteristics of your data before building any model. This helps you choose the right techniques and identify potential challenges.
* **Steps:**
    * **Distribution Analysis:** Examine the balance of sentiment classes.
    * **Visualization:** Create charts and graphs to understand the data better.

### 5. Text Normalization:**

* **Purpose:** Prepare the text data for the model. This involves cleaning and transforming the text to make it consistent and easier to process.
* **Common Techniques:**
- Clean Text from irrelavant words and special charcters.
- BERT's tokenizer splits contractions into their constituent words, like "can't" into "can" and "not". So, It may be beneficial to expand contractions in the input text to improve the model's performance.

### 6. Baseline Experiments: Classical ML Algorithm**

* **Goal:**  Establish a reference point for comparison with more advanced methods. 
#### Methodology:

1. **Numerical Representation:** 
    - TF-IDF assigns weights to words based on their frequency in the document and the corpus.

2. **Model Selection & Training:** 
    - Use Logistic Regression model as a baseline model because of its simplicity, speed, and interpretability.
    - Train the model on the vectorized training data.

3. **Evaluation:** Using my utils module [utils.py](https://github.com/heba14101998/WideBotAI/blob/main/utils.py)
   - Calculate the accuracy of each model on the validation data.
   - Plot the confusion matrices using Seaborn to visualize the model's predictions.
   - Print classification reports to get detailed performance metrics for each class.

4. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict sentiment on unseen text.

### 7. Advanced Experiments: Use BERT Base for tokenizing**

* **Goal:** Clearly state the goal of this experiment (e.g., "To explore the performance of a pre-trained language model like BERT for sentiment analysis").
#### Methodology:
1. **Preprocessing:** 
    - tokenization.
    - padding.
2. **Model Architecture:** Choose BERT Base model because of its ability to capture context and it is pre-training on a massive dataset.
3. **Fine-tuning**
4. **Evaluation:**  Use the same evaluation metrics as in the baseline experiment (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). 

### 8. Overall Conclusion**

While both the TF-IDF and BERT methods achieved moderate success in sentiment analysis, the BERT method showed potential for higher accuracy but requires further tuning and optimization. 

**TF-IDF:**

* Achieved a balanced performance with moderate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Is a simpler and faster approach, making it suitable for quick prototyping and exploration.

**BERT:**

* Showed promising results in training accuracy but suffered from potential overfitting, indicating a gap between training and validation performance. 
* Has the potential to achieve higher accuracy with careful fine-tuning and optimization.
* Requires more computational resources and time for training and evaluation.


### 9. Reflection Questions:

1. **What was the biggest challenge you faced in implementing Named Entity Recognition?** 

Here are some of the biggest challenges I've faced in implementing sentiment analysis, and the insights I've gained about NLP and sentiment analysis through this project:

    * Text data can contain errors, slang, sarcasm, and other factors that make it difficult to interpret accurately. 
    * Complex models like BERT need more code and data processing.
    * Finding optimal hyperparameters for BERT model is time-consuming and computationally expensive.

2. **What insights did you gain about NLP and NER through this project?** 

    * The quality and quantity of data are crucial for any NLP task, especially sentiment analysis. 
    * Text normalization and feature engineering are crucial for preparing text data for NLP models. This often involves removing noise, handling punctuation, and transforming text into a suitable representation for the chosen model.
    * Deciding between classical ML models (like TF-IDF with Logistic Regression) and more complex deep learning models (like BERT) depends on the dataset size, computational resources, and the desired level of accuracy. 
    * Understanding *why* a model makes a particular prediction can be difficult, especially with complex deep learning models. This is crucial for debugging, identifying biases, and gaining trust in the model.
