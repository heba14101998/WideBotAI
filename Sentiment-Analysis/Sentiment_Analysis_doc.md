# Sentiment Analysis using NLP: A Detailed Guide

---

### 1. Introduction**

Sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding customer feedback, gauging public opinion, and improving marketing strategies. This project aims to build a system that can accurately classify the sentiment expressed in text data.

* **Objectives:** 
    * Explore and visioalize text dataset.
    * Apply data normalization and preprocessing techniques.
    * Develop a sentiment analysis pipeline.
    * Compare the performance of traditional NLP methods (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) with a deep learning approach (BERT).
    * Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in terms of performance, interpretability, and computational resources.

### 2. Data Description

"Tweet Sentiment Extraction" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction/data), focuses on the task of **extracting sentiment-bearing phrases from tweets**. It's designed for training machine learning models to understand the nuanced sentiments expressed in tweets and identify the specific text within the tweet that conveys that sentiment. Here's a breakdown of the dataset:

**Data Structure:**

* **`train.csv`:** Contains the training data with 27480 rows.
* **`test.csv`:** Contains the testing data with 3534 rows.

**Columns:**

* **`text`:** The full text of the tweet. I will use this column in the following work.
* **`sentiment`:** The overall sentiment of the tweet, classified as either "positive", "negative", or "neutral".
* **`selected_text`:** The portion of the tweet that expresses the sentiment (this is the target variable). 

### 3. Tools and Libraries

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* **Purpose:** Understand the characteristics of your data before building any model. This helps you choose the right techniques and identify potential challenges.
* **Steps:**
    * **Distribution Analysis:** Examine the balance of sentiment classes.
    * **Visualization:** Create charts and graphs to understand the data better.

### 5. Text Normalization:**

* **Purpose:** Prepare the text data for the model. This involves cleaning and transforming the text to make it consistent and easier to process.
* **Common Techniques:**
- Clean Text from irrelavant words and special charcters.
- BERT's tokenizer splits contractions into their constituent words, like "can't" into "can" and "not". So, It may be beneficial to expand contractions in the input text to improve the model's performance.

### 6. Baseline Experiments: Classical ML Algorithm**

* **Goal:**  Establish a reference point for comparison with more advanced methods. 
#### Methodology:

1. **Feature Extraction:** 
    - TF-IDF assigns weights to words based on their frequency in the document and the corpus.

2. **Data Splitting:** 
    - Split the data into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).

3. **Selection & Training:** 
    - Use Logistic Regression model as a baseline model because of its simplicity, speed, and interpretability.
    - Train the model on the vectorized training data.

4. **Evaluation:** Using my utils module [utils.py](https://github.com/heba14101998/WideBotAI/blob/main/utils.py)
   - Calculate the accuracy of each model on the validation data.
   - Plot the confusion matrices using Seaborn to visualize the model's predictions.
   - Print classification reports to get detailed performance metrics for each class.

5. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict sentiment on unseen text.

### 7. Advanced Experiments: Use BERT Base for tokenizing**

* **Goal:** Clearly state the goal of this experiment (e.g., "To explore the performance of a pre-trained language model like BERT for sentiment analysis").
#### Methodology:
1. **Preprocessing:** 
    - tokenization.
    - padding.
2. **Model Architecture:** Choose BERT Base model because of its ability to capture context and it is pre-training on a massive dataset.
3. **Fine-tuning**
4. **Evaluation:**  Use the same evaluation metrics as in the baseline experiment (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score). 

### 8. Overall Conclusion**

The experiments conducted in this project will demonstrate the effectiveness of different approaches to Named Entity Recognition. Comparing the performance of the baseline, LSTM, and BERT models will highlight the advantages of using more advanced techniques like deep learning and pre-trained models.
