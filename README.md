## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 (or compatible)
- Conda 

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/WideBotAI.git
    ```
2. **Create a conda environment (optional):**
    ```bash
    $ conda create -n nlp-env python=3.9 
    ```
    This creates a Conda environment named `nlp-env` (you can choose your own name) with Python 3.9. 

3. **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    $ conda activate nlp-env
    ```
4. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Run each notebook to try the experiments**
